# SOLAR TRACKER 
arduino based project for a better future.
involves the use of a microcontroller to enable efficient harnessing of solar energy by optimizing the surface in contact with sunrays.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
---------------------

1. 1 x Arduino Uno
2. 2 x Servo Motors
3. 4 x Light Dependent Resistors (LDR)

Connections
------------

Connect the LDR's to 4 individual analog inputs on the arduino ( in this case, they are pins 0,1,2,3 )
Connect the two servos to pins 9 and 10
